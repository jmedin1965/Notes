====== 3D printer ======
Created Thursday 22 August 2024

creality ke 3d printer.  
You can hack it and change the software etc and it's wifi. 

Just printing stuff for a project. 
Good so far 

$480 there is a cheaper one but it doesn't have WiFi or touch screen or wire empty sensor etc.
I had an old Microsoft usb camera and plugged that into the 3d printer and it did this:

and it worked! And that is with the stock firmware.

This runs some sort of Linux and they even give you a menu option to enable root access!

I have made a few circuit board enclosures  and some mounts for weight sensors.
Going to do this:

and then put the results into openHab.


I haven't touched the pfsense at all. Too busy doing other things. I will get around to it one day I will keep all you emails so I can look at it later.
I want to firstly get the web stuff from the paid domain hosting back to my local servers and then do it.

Currently suffering from a cold that Alison so graciously gave me, so today is a rest day (like every other day really) 


I have also just found that it supports mqtt and if you use home assistant there is stuff you can do from there as well:
