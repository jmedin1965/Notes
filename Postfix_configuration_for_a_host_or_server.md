# Postfix configuration for a host/server
Created Friday 01 December 2023

I'm using Postfix to send out emails from all the vm's that need to send emails out. It's pre-installed most of the time. If not just do an

apt install postfix

To send out emails, if the hosts domain is not real, then you need to change myorigin to a valid domain and also use the bse-mailx package instead of mailutils. If you do use mail from mailutils, then use the -r option. If you don't, the from field of your outgoing messages will be invalid, which will cause the message to be rejected.

send options
------------

mydomain = servers domain

myhostname = fully qualified name

myorigin = This is important if your domain 
is not a real domain because outgoing get stamped using
this as the from address. By default on ubuntu, this is set to a file

mydestination = a list of command separated fully qualifies server names. All
of these are considered to be localy handled by this server, and are delivered
localy.

relayhost = This is the host that will reay outgoing mail for us.

mynetworks = space separated list of local networks





Install as a standard CT template in Proxmox. No need for a valid external domain, can just use fake internal domain.

Configure
---------

### Relaying

Configuration>>Mail Proxy>> Ports
Default Relay: foreman.jmsh-home.dtdns.net - ip or name of host to receive mail from external
Relay Port: 25 - port of above host
Disable MX lookup (SMTP): yes - we don't want to look up MX records, just use these settings instead
Smarthost: smtp.dodo.com.au:25 - our external relay

REF: <https://electrictoolbox.com/configure-postfix-external-connections/>

to get foreman.jmsh-home.dtdns.net to accept email requites;

inet_interfaces = all
or
inet_interfaces = locahost ip_address

in /etc/postfix/main.cf

but this did not work. I also had to change /etc/postfix/master.cf

127.0.0.1:smtp inet n - - - - smtpd
to
smtp inet n - - - - smtpd


### Relay Domains

Configuration>>Mail Proxy>> Ports

A list of all domains tha we will receive and forward from external. Everything else will be rejected.

### Ports

I ended up swapping input and output ports. By default, port 25 is the external port, and 26 is the internal. Since I'm forwarding from the firewall, I created a rule to forward external port 25 to port 26 on the GW.

Configuration>>Mail Proxy>> Ports
External SMTP Port 26
External SMTP Port 25

#### Networks

A list of networks that are considered local. We will relal from everyone on this list

#### Mail Filter

#### Added Action - Has Been Scanned Notice

Just adds a message to outgoing mail. More as a test and to make sure incoming mail gets tagged.

This e-mail has been processed and 
scanned by Proxmox Mail Gateway

#### created filter - Add Disclaimer

Enabled disclaimer on outgoing mail Priority 60

#### created filter - Add Scanned Notice

Add Scanned Notice on incoming mail, Priority 60

to do
=====


* ‚òê Add Postfix settings to Ansible, make sure we exclude the Proxmox mail gateway and make different settings for our internal mail receiver
