This is great but snapshot format can't be changed



ZnapZend

Sounds promising but does not have a config file instead it saves config in the volume itself. This has advantages and disadvantages.

The snapshot format is configurable and the snapshot can be renamed and it will still retain the configuration and snap history.

------------------------------------------------

This is a suit of opensource tools that I stumbled on to by an Italian mob. Of interest is a tool to schedule automatic snapshots.
