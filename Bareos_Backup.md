# Bareos Backup
Created Monday 17 February 2025

Greg got me to install bareos as a backup utility. It's much like Tivoli, and is a fork of bacula.

I am using postgresql as a database on it and it is being managed by db-config-common so it "should" update cleanly by doing an apt upgrade. However, the schema will need updating sometimes. Please read

<https://docs.bareos.org/IntroductionAndTutorial/UpdatingBareos.html#updating-the-database-scheme>

If you do have trouble. It's a good idea to read the breaking changes in the upgrade guide. The community edition is not version locked, so the updates happen automagically however. So I guess, have a good backup just in case. Is this a catch-22 ?

Adding a new client
-------------------

I have a script, bareos-add-client.sh, in the scripts repo. It does work but again probably needs some work. Once it has added the client, create a job schedule in 

[/etc/bareos/bareos-dir.d/job](file:///etc/bareos/bareos-dir.d/job)

you need to name it, user an existing jobDef or create a new one, user the correct Client.

Job {
  Name = "backup-proxmox-host01-fd"
  JobDefs = "BackupProxMoxServer"
  Client = "host01-fd"
}

I always get caught with the permissions. This file needs to be owned by bareos user and group. The issue a restart in the bconsole.

To do
-----


* ‚òê I currently have a simple install that needs work. Need to create another volumes pool. The one I have is small. Need to do a long term pool on my backup server. or possibly migrate it to cloud storage. I would then need to encrypt the volumes <https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/DataEncryption.html#dataencryption>
