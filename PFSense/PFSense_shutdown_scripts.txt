====== PFSense shutdown scripts ======
Created Thursday 16 May 2024

Looks like you can create shutdown scripts. They are run from /etc/pfSense-rc.shutdown[[.]] At the end, this script runs all executable scripts at [[/usr/local/etc/rc.d/shutdown.*.sh.]] I have created a script on pfs03, which is a physical server. This script signals the condoling sonoff to turn off after 30 seconds.**d**
