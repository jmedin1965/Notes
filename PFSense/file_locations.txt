/usr/local/pkg/bind.xml

===== Services auto source =====

Looks like all services as they load source these files or folders

[[/etc/rc.conf]]         ←  yes this one does get sourced contrary to what is in this file, however on an update, it will probably get cleared back to defailt
[[/etc/rc.conf.local]] ← put local changes to all services here
[[/usr/local/etc/rc.conf.d/service-name]] ← This can be a file or a dir. If a dir, all files are sourced in it. this file is sorced by the service only
