1. install Downloader by AFTVnews.com first
2. Enable unknown sources install on [AndroidTV](./AndroidTV.md)
	1. settings>>System>>About>>
	2. Then click on "Android TV OS build" 7 times untill debug mode is enabled
3. enter hdo.app/tv or 795281
4. alow downloaded app install permissions
5. Once you start HDO up, it will ask to install a player. You need to let it  and you need to give HDO all install permissions, then remove the permissions
	1. I haven't worked out how to remove permissions after the fact. So when it installns, don't click open. Just cluck done and then back and remove permissions there.

[BeeTV](./BeeTV.md) is the same as above except in downloaded type beetvapk.org. I'm sure beetvapk.org is the official site, but can't be 100% sure.
beetvapk.org

can also use
