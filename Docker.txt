===== Home Assistant firefox-java-vnc-flash =====

This is my first, and an example on how to build a docker image. I had this working for along time on docker and am converting it into a Home Assistant addon. I use it to get a remote desktop session to a very old CISCO server that does not have HTML5, so it still uses Java and Flash.

1. Build a base image, with basic run.sh command
2. Upload image to github Packages Docker repo

	b. Generate a tocken
	c. docker login --username [[jmedin1965]] --password the-tokenghcro.io

	e. docker push ghcr.io/jmedin1965/firefox-java-vnc-flash-base:latest
	f. This example also shows how to use github actions to auto generate the image every time a git push is done on a repo
